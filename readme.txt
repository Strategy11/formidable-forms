== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get started with the best forms for WordPress? =
The fastest way to build a form is to use the example we built for you. After you activate Formidable, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice.

Go to the Formidable page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template or another free template and click "Create".

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode generator. Choose your new web form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads. The contact form template will get you up and running fast.

= Why isn't WordPress sending emails? =
When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

   1. Double check the email address in your Email action on the settings page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are you receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, notifications will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different address in your settings.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing alternative and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If these steps do not fix the problem and other WP signup emails are not going out, please reach out to your web host.
