Let's take a look at all the powerful features that you get with Formidable for making amazing lead forms, subscription forms, request a quote forms, donation forms, payment order forms, surveys, polls and more.

= Drag & Drop Form Maker and Advanced Form Builder =

The Formidable drag & drop form builder allows you to quickly create unlimited surveys, quizzes, registration forms, and just about any other type of form that you want.

Our form builder comes with all the powerful form fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

* Single line text (for names, phone numbers, addresses, and more)
* Email
* Website/URL
* Paragraph text
* Radio buttons
* Checkboxes
* Dropdown select boxes
* Number
* Phone number
* Hidden fields
* User ID
* HTML block

= Complete Entry Management for Forms and Surveys =

Formidable allows you to view all your form and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard.

Once a user submits a form, their response is automatically stored in your WordPress database. 

Formidable is a **100% GDPR-friendly** form generator. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving submissions entirely. Alternatively, you can add a GDPR checkbox field to your lead forms and payment forms to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to another service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, and import anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited email notifications and autoresponders triggered by form submissions. 

On top of that, you can easily customize the success message the user sees after they submit the form, or redirect them to another page for your more advanced form needs.

= The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Form Styler =

With our built-in form styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your forms. With just a few clicks, your email form and advanced forms can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, Formidable applies a single styling template to your WordPress forms. But if you want a custom form style for each individual sidebar form, and registration form, you can upgrade to Formidable Forms Pro.

= Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports = 

Formidable comes with a built-in survey feature, so you can quickly create powerful surveys and see beautiful reports.

The best part is that you can do this all within Formidable without any third-party tools.

= Quickly Create Advanced WordPress Registration Forms for Any Use Case = 

Whether you need to create a youth sports team, event, or church retreat registration form, Formidable has got you covered. Unlike other form plugins, Formidable comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the most powerful registration forms.

Then, our marketing integrations and APIs can send the email form and other form data anywhere you want.

= Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments = 

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable is more than just a contact form plugin. You can use Formidable to create payment forms and accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create order forms and purchase forms with our drag & drop form builder. 

You can even use Formidable to create WooCommerce forms with custom fields (more on that later).

= Grow Your Business with Marketing Integrations =

We know that marketing is the key to grow your business. That's why Formidable allows you to connect your WP forms, payment forms, calculators, and advanced forms with a marketing platform of your choice.

We integrate with popular email marketing services like:

* MailChimp
* AWeber
* Constant Contact
* GetResponse
* MailPoet
* Active Campaign
* Salesforce
* HubSpot
* Campaign Monitor

On top of these native integrations, we also integrate with Zapier, so you can quickly route your form data to over 1,500+ more services with just a few clicks.

= Create Data-Driven Web Applications with Formidable Views = 

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature that makes Formidable far more than just a form builder plugin. Views allow you to flexibly display any submitted form data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web applications like real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable is not your average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

= Increase Your Sales with WooCommerce Product Order Forms =

Formidable is the only WordPress form builder plugin that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce orders.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product order forms, so you can increase your store sales.

You can use Formidable to add a WooCommerce product configurator with custom calculation fields. Then automatically send the order info to the WooCommerce cart with variable pricing options.

Need your customers to upload a file when they purchase a product? No problem. Simply drag & drop a file upload field into your linked up WooCommerce order form and you're done.

You can even show submitted form values in the WooCommerce purchase receipt emails as well as trigger SMS text messages or marketing integrations when an order is completed.

= Make Powerful Quiz Forms & Calculators =

In addition to simple order forms, you can also use Formidable to create quiz forms and calculator forms.

More on quiz forms later, but here are some example web calculators you can quickly add to your WordPress site:

* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/advanced-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Advanced Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/simple-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Basic Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/automobile-payment-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Car Payment Calculator</a>
* BMI Calculator
* User Age Calculator
* Online Quote Calculator
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/nps-survey-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey Calculator</a>

... and our powerful form calculations allow you to build just about any other type of calculator form.

If that wasn't enough, you can also use Formidable to create quizzes, polls, and surveys on your WordPress site and display results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Our goal is to go beyond simple contact forms and allow you to create form-based solutions without any code :)

= Create WordPress User Registration Forms, Profile Forms, and More = 

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need more advanced forms.

The Formidable Form builder allows you to customize your WordPress user registration forms, so you can collect additional data when the user profile is created.

With our front-end editing, you can also build custom profile forms and allow users to keep their profile updated, or even progressively add to the profile from a set of forms, from the first lead form to the last payment form.

Our front-end form editing feature is unique to us, and you will not find any other WordPress form plugin offering such a solution with the level of extendability that we do.

= Beautiful Graphs and Reports to Help You Analyze and Showcase Data = 

We believe that data alone does no good if you can't analyze it. That's why we make it easy for you to analyze your survey, quiz, calculator, and other form data with beautiful graphs and reports.

You can even showcase form data on the front-end of your website by embedding graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

= All the Advanced Form Fields and Features You Need to Grow Your Business =

Formidable goes far above and beyond basic forms to offer all the advanced form fields and features you need to grow your business.

This includes things like multi-page forms, save and continue, cascading form fields, powerful conditional logic, partial submissions, invisible spam protection, front-end user post submission, calculators, user-tracking, and so much more.

We're on a mission to offer an all-in-one solution-focused WordPress form plugin, so you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your form maker to do everything you want.

= Extend and Customize Your Forms - Developer's Dream Come True =

Formidable is the form plugin of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies because it helps them build complex form solutions and basic forms quickly and defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. We believe big projects don't always need big resources.

That's why we made Formidable the most extendable WordPress form builder plugin on the market.

You can easily route your form data with our powerful API. Formidable Views allow you to display form data anywhere on the front-end, so you can quickly create data-driven web applications.

On top of that, our hooks and filters allow you to extend Formidable to meet your needs. We even include hundreds of code examples in our docs to give you the confidence to get started.

= How do I get started with the best WordPress form plugin? =
The fastest way to build a contact form is to use the template we built for you. After you activate Formidable, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice. That's it!

Want to make a new form? Go to the Formidable -> Forms page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template on the form buider and click "Create".

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode builder. Choose your contact form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the contact page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads.

= My WordPress forms are not sending emails. Why not? =
When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

   1. Double check that your email address is present and correct in your Email form action on the form settings page of the form builder. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, form emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different email address in your settings in the form builder.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If none of these steps fix the email problem and no other WP emails are going out, please get in touch with your web host.
