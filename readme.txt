== Changelog ==
= 2.03 =
* New: Add a combined list of all entries on the Formidable -> Entries page instead of defaulting to the first form
* New: Replace submit input with button for new forms. This allows us to show the loading indicator on top of the button instead of outside. This applies to new forms only. Existing forms will need the submit button HTML adjusted to see this new styling. But we decided it was best for reverse compatability if we don't change it automatically
* New: Add frm_after_title hook for inserting content between the title and form fields
* Enhancement: Speed up adding and editing field options and conditional logic in the form builder
* Enhancement: Don't save the field options until the whole form is saved
* Tweak: Pass error array in frm_get_paged_fields instead of true/false. If you are using the frm_get_paged_fields hook, it's possible your code may need to be adjusted.
* Fix: styling issue when select field moves when changing between a blank and not blank option
* Fix: Make sure "Activate" button for add-ons is specific to subsite in multisite network
* Removed: pro fields and styling options from the visual styler, extra pro version css, and registering pro scripts. We don't need unused options.
* **Pro Version** *
* New: Add multi page progress bars and rootline to jump to different pages
* New: Add a page number parameter to the url when the form page changes
* New: Auto-save drafts on page turn when drafts are enabled
* New: Add save button to back-end entries. This allows an entry to be saved from any page when editing.
* New: Break out repeating sections in the email and frm-single-entry shortcode. Now they repeat instead of separate with commas.
* New: Add options for email content/single entry shortcode: include_extras="section,page,html", include_fields="10,15", exclude_fields="10,15"
* New: Change the time field to multiple dropdowns that always save in hh:mm format. This allows for secondary sorting by time fields in views. Using h:i A for the time format in a shortcode will be forced to g:i A.

* Enhancement: Hide form on page load and fade it in to prevent conditional fields flashing
* Enhancement: Order the post type dropdown by post key instead of defaulting to the order of post type creation

* Fix: Do not delete values in frm_item_metas table for all fields selected in Create Post action (such as the conditional logic).
