= All the features you need for beautiful WordPress forms =
Create unlimited forms with all the essential field types.

* Single line text (for names, phone numbers, addresses, and more)
* Email
* Website/URL
* Paragraph text
* Radio buttons
* Checkboxes
* Dropdown select boxes
* Number
* Phone number
* Hidden fields
* User ID
* HTML block
* reCaptcha (Invisible or one-click checkbox)

= Form templates =
Create forms in seconds with [pre-built form templates](https://formidableforms.com/features/wordpress-form-templates/). Or add your own form templates and export the forms to share. A free contact form template is included when you install Formidable Forms. We also have a growing library of [downloadable form templates](https://formidableforms.com/downloads/category/form-templates/).

= Customize your WordPress forms =
Whether you start from scratch or from a form template, customize your forms however you would like.

* Send **unlimited form email notifications and autoresponders**.
* Use **input placeholder text** in form fields that clear when typing starts.
* Use our ready-made CSS classes (or your own custom CSS classes) to arrange your form fields and create **multi-column forms**
* **Modify the form HTML** for your individual needs.
* Customize the form success message and submit button text.
* Redirect to another page after submit or show content from a protected page.

= Style your WordPress contact forms with no code =
Use the built-in [visual form style generator](https://formidableforms.com/features/wordpress-visual-form-styler/) to instantly customize the look and feel of your WordPress forms. With just a few clicks, your forms can be transformed to match your personal style. A single form styling template will be applied to all the forms on your site. But if you decide you need different styles for different forms, Formidable Forms Pro is waiting.

= Publish WordPress forms with ease =
Once your WP form is built and designed just the way you like it, publish with an easy-to-use **shortcode builder** UI. Direct links are also available on a blank page for **form previews** and **email surveys**.

**Honeypot spam protection** is included in every website form. Or add Invisible reCAPTCHA, one-click reCAPTCHA, and Akismet for extra Spam control in your contact forms.

= Save every form submission =
You may already know it, but sending emails with your self-hosted WordPress website isn't 100% reliable. But every lead captured in your online contact forms is important. Don't lose a single one! This is why Formidable saves every contact form submission in your WordPress database and lists them on your Formidable -> Entries page. Now even if a form email notification fails, you won’t lose a lead.

Looking for **GDPR compliance for forms**? No problem. Turn off IP tracking or stop saving form submissions. Or add a checkbox field to your form to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to another service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export form leads to a CSV** then open it in Excel or import anywhere.

Plus, don't lose leads by accidentally deleting a form. **Send forms to the trash** and recover them if needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get started with the best WordPress contact form plugin? =

The fastest way to build a contact form is to use the contact form template we built for you. After you activate Formidable Forms, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice. That's it!

Want to make a new contact form? Go to the Formidable -> Forms page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template and click "Load Template". Now Save your contact form.

Next, go to edit the page where you would like to publish your contact form. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode builder. Choose your contact form and insert it into your WordPress page. Save your page, and you're done.

Get more detail on [using the contact form template](https://formidableforms.com/wordpress-contact-form-template-to-unique/ "using the contact form template") in our blog.

= My contact forms are not sending emails. Why not? =

Try the following steps:

   1. Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in your Email form action on the form "Settings" page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...). If these emails don't work on your site, form emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box
   4. Try a different email address in your contact form settings.
   5. Install Postman SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If none of these steps fix the problem with your form emails, and other site emails are not going out, please contact your web host. You can also [read more about WordPress emails not sending](https://formidableforms.com/wordpress-not-sending-emails-smtp/ "read more about WordPress emails not sending") in our blog.

= How do I edit the field names in my forms? =

The field and form names and descriptions are all changed with in-place edit. Just click on the text you would like to change, and it will turn into a text field.

* A UI pick-me-up in preparation of things to come in 4.0.
* New: Use CSS grids for better layouts. If you would like your column layouts to show in Internet Explorer, you'll need to turn on the old styling in the Formidable -> Global settings. The grids use a 12-column layout with classes that range from frm1 (1 column of 12) to frm12 (span all 12 columns). (Thanks for the feedback from our feedback group!)

* Fix: quotation marks were being escaped in frm_form_attributes and frm_form_div_attributes hooks
* Removed: The preview page option in the global settings is no longer used. The form preview page is now generated.
* Removed: The placeholder fallback javascript for old versions of IE is gone. No need to give everyone extra scripts to load.
* Deprecated the accordion javascript checkbox in global settings since it isn't used by the plugin. If you had this box checked, you'll still see it. Once you uncheck it the option will no longer appear.
* **Pro Version Forms**
* New: Move Formidable Pro to its own plugin during update or install. Wahoo!

* New: Added param checking to inline conditionals: [if 25 equals='param' param='set-name-here'] and [if get param="level" equals="gold"]

* Separate Pro and Lite translations
* Enhancement: If a form creates posts and is set to not save entries, save the created post.
* Enhancement: Run form install on an API route instead of the admin ajax route and make sure there won't be multiple instances of the install running at once.

* Views can now be filtered by fields in the repeating sections.
* Added [parent_id] shortcode for use in views. This shortcode will only have a value when the displaying entries in repeating sections.

* Added order parameter to frm-entry-links
* Allow options in a post status field to come from the form builder. The options should have separate values and the saved values can include 'publish', 'draft', 'private', 'scheduled'.

* Fix: Improve dropping a field between two sections.
* Fix: Remove nonce check for frm-entry-update-field shortode. Page caching gives front-end nonce checks issues.
* Fix: We changed the parameters sent to the frm_after_update_field hook without realizing it. The 'field_id' attribute was sometimes an object, but was previously always an integer. This has been updated for reverse compatibility, and 'field' has been added with the full field object.
* Fix: If you put -100 for the start date in a date field, -100 would show in the date field instead of 1915. This is now working correctly for dynamic values like this with three digits.
