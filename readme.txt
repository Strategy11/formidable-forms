Let’s take a look at all the powerful features for making an amazing lead form, survey or poll, subscription form, request a quote form, payment form, user registration form, or anything else. With Formidable, there’s no limit to what you can achieve! The possibilities are endless.

Formidable adapts to YOUR needs.

Want to run quizzes on your site? Formidable is your quiz maker with all the features you need to create and run both educational quizzes and the beloved (and addictive) BuzzFeed style quizzes.

Our team has worked hard to create the Swiss Army Knife for WordPress. Plus, we’ve made integrations that fit into your tech stack.

Check out some of our main features below:

== Drag & Drop Form Maker ==

Our form maker comes with all the powerful fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

Formidable drag and drop forms allow you to quickly build unlimited surveys, quizzes, price calculators, and whatever else you need.

== Complete Entry Management for Web Forms and Surveys ==

When a user submits a web form, it's stored in your WordPress database so you won’t lose any leads. Formidable allows you to view all your quiz and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard (even in the free version!).

Even though the entries are saved, it's still a **GDPR-friendly** form generator. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving submissions entirely. Or add a GDPR checkbox field to your lead forms and payment forms to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to an external service like Mailchimp? No problem. **Export leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, or import it anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited email notifications and autoresponders triggered by submissions.

On top of that, you can easily customize the success message after a form is submitted, or redirect visitors to another page.

== The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Styler ==

With our built-in styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your website form. With just a few clicks, your email form can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, a single styling template is created. If you want a custom form style for each footer and sidebar form, check out the premium version of Formidable.

== Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports ==

Formidable Pro includes an intuitive survey feature (like Survey Monkey, but without the high costs), so you can quickly create powerful surveys with Net Promoter Scores (NPS), Likert fields, star ratings, image radio buttons, and more.

We believe that data alone does no good if you can't analyze it. That’s why we make it easy to analyze data from a survey, quiz, or calculator. Beautiful reports will be waiting for you, or create your own customized graphs. Our graphs and reports will help you analyze and showcase data.

You can even showcase data on the front-end of your website. Just embed graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

The best part is that you can do this all without any third-party tools.

== Quickly Create an Advanced WordPress Registration Form for Any Use Case ==

Whether you need to create a youth sports team, event, or church retreat registration, Formidable has you covered. Unlike other contact form plugins, Formidable comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the best registration forms.

Then, our marketing integrations and APIs can send the data anywhere you want.

== Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments ==

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable is more than just a WordPress contact form plugin. You can use it to create a payment form and accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create an order form, donation form, or purchase form.

You can even create a WooCommerce form with custom fields.

== Make Data-Driven Web Applications with a Formidable View ==

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature that makes Formidable far more than just a contact form plugin. Views allow you to flexibly display any submitted data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web apps. We see real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable is not your average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

== Increase Sales with WooCommerce Product Order Forms ==

Formidable is the only WordPress form builder plugin that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce orders.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product order forms, so you can increase your store sales.

You can create a WooCommerce form to use as a WooCommerce product configurator with custom calculation fields. Then automatically send the order form info to the WooCommerce cart with variable pricing options.

== Make Powerful Quiz Forms & Calculators ==

In addition to a simple order form, you can also create quizzes or web calculators.

More on quizzes later, but here are some example online calculators that you can quickly add to your WordPress site:

* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/advanced-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Advanced Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/simple-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Basic Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/automobile-payment-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Car Payment Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/nps-survey-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/bmi-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">BMI Calculator</a> and more Health and Fitness Calculators
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/age-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">User Age Calculator</a>
* Online Quote Calculator
* Finance Calculator
* Booking Cost Calculator
* Product Price Calculator

... and our powerful calculated fields allow you to build just about anything.

You can also create a poll, or survey on your WordPress site and display the results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Now you can create custom form-based solutions without any code.

== Create a WordPress User Registration Form, Profile Form, and More ==

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need a form plugin that allows you to customize your WordPress user registration form and collect data with a user profile.

With our front-end editing, you can build a custom profile form for users to keep their profile up to date. You can even progressively add to the profile from a set of forms. Everything from the first lead form to the last payment form can extend the user profile. Once logged in, all new submissions in a quiz, or support form can be linked to that user account.

You will not find any other WordPress form plugin offering a front-end editing solution with the same level of extendability.

== All the Advanced Fields & Features You Need to Grow Your Business ==

Formidable goes far above and beyond with features like multi-page forms, save and continue, cascading form fields, and powerful conditional logic. Then add partial submissions, invisible spam protection, front-end user post submission, calculated fields, user flow, quizzes, and so much more. Additionally, our Payment fields will help you create a donation form, booking form, credit card form, or other payment form.

We're on a mission to offer all-in-one solution-focused forms. This way you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your form maker to do everything you want.

== Extend & Customize - A Developer's Dream Come True ==

Formidable is the solution of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies. It helps you build complex solutions and simple forms quickly to defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. That's why we made Formidable the most extendable WordPress form plugin on the market. We want to make it possible for anyone to defy gravity and build anything.

A Formidable View allows you to display data anywhere, so you can quickly create data-driven web apps.

On top of that, our hooks and filters allow you to extend Formidable to meet your most advanced needs. We even include hundreds of code examples in our docs to give you the confidence to get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get started with the best forms for WordPress? =
The fastest way to build a form is to use the example we built for you. After you activate Formidable, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice.

Go to the Formidable page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template or another free template and click "Create".

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode generator. Choose your new Stripe form, quiz, or web form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads. The contact form template will get you up and running fast.

= Why isn't WordPress sending emails? =
When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

   1. Double check the email address in your Email action on the settings page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are you receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, notifications will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different address in your settings.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing alternative and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If these steps don't fix the problem and other WP signup emails are not going out, please reach out to your web host.

* New: Dropdown placeholders now use placeholder styling.
* New: The honeypot field is now hidden using a new style rule to help avoid a styling conflict with RTL languages in Elementor.
* New: The honeypot field has been updated to make it more random and less obvious.
* New: An additional attribute has been added for basic honeypot protection to help avoid conflicts with false postiives caused by autofilling form fields.
* Fix: Stripe subscriptions would fail with a No such plan error if the payment action was created when a different mode was active when using the free Stripe action.
* Fix: Entries would not get deleted on Stripe payment failure, and old entry data would not get displayed with payment errors, when using the free Stripe action.
* Fix: The payment expire date and next subscription billing date values were not accurate for payment table records when using the free Stripe action.
* Fix: A wp_frm_payments doesn't exist database error would get logged when viewing an entry when payments migrations had not run yet.
* Fix: Conditional logic wasn't working for redirect confirmation actions when using the free Stripe action. The same redirect URL would always be used regardless of field values.
* Fix: An unexpected redirect to global settings would happen when trying to view payments when only the Paypal payments migration has run.
* Fix: Stripe scripts were not loading properly when the Lite minified JS was available but not the minified Pro scripts when using the free Stripe action.
* Fix: CAPTCHA fields were not properly initializing inside of Elementor pop ups.
* Fix: Gateway fields were always hidden from the form builder. These fields will appear again when the Stripe or Authorize.Net add ons are active.

= 6.5 =
* New: Stripe forms are now available for free without the need for other add ons. Global settings now include a Stripe section. Payment fields and Collect Payment actions have been added, as well as the Global setting for defining the default currency.

= 6.4.2 =
* New: Entry statuses are now shown with color coded backgrounds on admin entry list pages.
* New: Additional attributes have been added to collapsible sections in the form builder page to improve accessibility.
* Fix: A fatal error would occur on when sending tracking data when the php_uname function was disabled and unavailable.
* Fix: The option to save and reload when activating an add on was not reloading the page when the setting to save the builder with AJAX was on.
* Fix: An Automatic conversion of false to array deprecation message would get logged when saving styles in newer versions of PHP.

* Admin footer links and the floating support button have been removed for websites that use a whitelabel setting.

= 6.4.1 =
* New: The pop up that prevents navigating away from the form builder when changes have been made will now also pop up when options are added or removed.
* New: Forms without names will now appear as (no title) when displayed as options inside of a Gutenberg block.

* New: Required attributes are now defined on the radio and checkbox field groups instead of on each input for improved accessibility.
* Fix: A global JavaScript variable conflict was causing a conflict with the Google Spreadsheets add on. This was causing issues with authorizing and deauthorizing Google Sheets.

= 6.4 =
* New: A floating button has been added to some admin pages with links for documentation and support.
* New: When importing, if a matching trashed form is found based on a key match, it will be deleted before the import begins. This prevents conflicts that cause field shortcodes and conditional logic not to update as expected when imported.
* New: The field search has been improved. Inactive fields will no longer appear when there is no match, and categories will no longer appear when no children fields are visible.
* New: Captcha key settings will now be trimmed on save to avoid unecessary whitespace characters reported to cause issues in some cases.
* New: Form previews inside of Gutenberg blocks are no longer interactive and can no longer be submitted when clicking the submit button in the preview.

= 6.3.1 =
* Security: Additional validation has been added when installing plugins from the WordPress repository.
* New: A new "Open in new tab" toggle has been added to confirmation actions with redirect rules.
* New: Dropdown field options now use less whitespace, reducing the amount of required HTML downloaded to load the form.

* New: Support for a new remove_accents option has been added for field shortcodes.
* Fix: There was additional unexpected white space on some mobile widths when distraction free mode is not active.

= 6.3 =
* New: Improved the readability of error messages when importing XML.

* Fix: Confirmation action redirects were no longer enforcing the sanitize_url option in shortcodes.
* Fix: Repeater icons would appear darker than expected in Gutenberg block previews.
* Fix: Improper use of the frm_validate_entry filter will now throw a message. Previously when a null value was returned, no validation would error, and a warning (or fatal error in PHP8) would occur. Now unless an array is returned, the previous error messages will be preserved and a message will be triggered for improper use.
* Fix: The autocomplete page dropdown would be cut off because of an overflow styling issue when embedding a form into an existing page in a modal.
* Fix: Using "description" as a field key would trigger a fatal error on entries list pages.
* Fix: Search wasn't working on the Import/Export page.
* The form builder now applies more strict filtering and escaping when previewing real time updates.

= 6.2.3 =
* Fix: Forms submitted with AJAX would display an unexpected "We're sorry. It looks like you've already submitted that" message when WooCommerce v7.6.0 is active.
* Fix: Added an extra check so invalid serialized data doesn't trigger any warning or errors when an unexpected array key type is found.
* Fix: XML exports would fail to import because of an unexpected carriage return at the beginning of the file, or an unexpected meta tag added by the Equity WordPress theme. In these cases the XML string will now be corrected in order for the import to work.
* Fix: Added a callable check to avoid a "Call to undefined function FrmProAddonsController::print_grace" error when upgrading.
* Fix: The license warning banner would overflow on top of other page elements.
* Fix: Added additional validation for style settings. Unexpected invalid characters will now be cleaned up automatically when a style is saved. A new warning will now also be displayed in the styler when a broken stylesheet is detected.
* Fix: The utf8_encode function has been replaced as it is deprecated in PHP 8.2.
* Input border radius is now included in styler card preview samples.

= 6.2.2 =
* Fix: Redirects to PayPal were not working, resulting in a white screen instead.

* Fix: Shortcodes were not getting replaced in redirect confirmation actions.

* New: The setting to Submit this form with AJAX has been moved into Lite. Forms can now be submitted without reloading the whole page.
* New: Multiselect dropdown items used in admin pages will now include the checkbox role and the aria-checked attribute for improved accessibility with screen readers.
* Fix: When searching for templates with the word application, all ready made solutions would appear first, making it difficult to search for an application form template.
* Fix: The User Flow add on would display a time difference of 0 seconds as 52 years.
* Fix: When using some shortcode options, including sanitize_url=0 or sanitize=0, the option would be treated the same as 1. 0 values will now be treated as off.
* Fix: The gravity forms importer would not successfully install when clicking the Get Started button. Styling issues when the importer add on is active have also been fixed.
* Fix: A redirect confirmation action with an empty redirect URL would exit early and fallback to using a message without checking the frm_redirect_url filter first for redirects set in custom code.
* Fix: Field type checks have been added in several points to avoid decoding when unnecessary. This would cause issues when trying to use a JSON string as input in a Paragraph field.
* The delete option for a collapsed section is no longer faded out.
* Duplicating a collapsed section is no longer disabled.
* Several functions deprecated in version 2.x have been removed.
