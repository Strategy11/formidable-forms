Let’s take a look at all the powerful features for making an amazing lead form, survey form, poll, subscription form, request a quote form, donation form, user registration form, contact form, or payment form.

== Drag & Drop Form Maker and Advanced Form Builder ==

The Formidable drag & drop form builder allows you to quickly build unlimited surveys, quizzes, registration forms, price calculators, and whatever else you want.

Our form maker comes with all the powerful fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

== Complete Entry Management for Forms and Surveys ==

Formidable allows you to view all your quiz and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard. When a user submits a contact form, it's stored in your WordPress database so you won’t lose any leads.

Formidable is a **100% GDPR-friendly** form generator. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving submissions entirely. Or add a GDPR checkbox field to your lead forms and payment forms to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to an external service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, or import anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited email notifications and autoresponders triggered by form submissions. 

On top of that, you can easily customize the success message after a contact form is submitted, or redirect visitors to another page.

== The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Form Styler ==

With our built-in styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your contact form. With just a few clicks, your email form can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, a single styling template is added to your WordPress forms. If you want a custom form style for each footer and sidebar form, check out the premium version of Formidable.

== Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports ==

Formidable comes with a built-in survey feature, so you can quickly create powerful surveys and see beautiful reports.

Our graphs and reports will help you analyze and showcase data. We believe that data alone does no good if you can't analyze it. That’s why we make it easy to analyze data from a survey, quiz, or price calculator.

You can even showcase data on the front-end of your website. Just embed graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

The best part is that you can do this all without any third-party tools.

== Quickly Create an Advanced WordPress Registration Form for Any Use Case ==

Whether you need to create a youth sports team, event, or church retreat registration, Formidable has you covered. Unlike other form plugins, Formidable comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the best registration forms.

Then, our marketing integrations and APIs can send the data anywhere you want.

== Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments ==

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable is more than just a WordPress contact form plugin. You can use it to create a payment form to accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create an order form, donation form, or purchase form with our drag & drop form builder. 

You can even use the plugin to create a WooCommerce form with custom fields.

== Make Data-Driven Web Applications with a Formidable View ==

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature that makes Formidable far more than just a contact form builder plugin. Views allow you to flexibly display any submitted form data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web applications. We see real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable is not your average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

== Increase Sales with WooCommerce Product Order Forms ==

Formidable is the only WordPress form builder plugin that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce orders.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product order forms, so you can increase your store sales.

You can add a WooCommerce product configurator with custom calculation fields. Then automatically send the order info to the WooCommerce cart with variable pricing options.

== Make Powerful Quiz Forms & Calculators ==

In addition to a simple order form, you can also create quizzes or web calculators.

More on quizzes later, but here are some example online calculators that you can quickly add to your WordPress site:

* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/advanced-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Advanced Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/simple-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Basic Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/automobile-payment-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Car Payment Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/nps-survey-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/bmi-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">BMI Calculator</a> and more Health and Fitness Calculators
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/age-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">User Age Calculator</a>
* Online Quote Calculator
* Finance Calculator
* Booking Cost Calculator
* Price Calculator

... and our powerful calculated fields allow you to build just about anything.

You can also create a poll, or survey on your WordPress site and display the results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Now you can go beyond a simple contact form plugin and create custom form-based solutions without any code.

== Create a WordPress User Registration Form, Profile Form, and More ==

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need a form maker that allows you to customize your WordPress user registration form and collect data with a user profile.

With our front-end editing, you can build a custom profile form for users to keep their profile up to date. You can even progressively add to the profile from a set of forms. Everything from the first lead form to the last payment form can extend the user profile. Once logged in, all new submissions in a quiz, or support form can be linked to that user account.

You will not find any other WordPress form plugin offering a front-end editing solution with the same level of extendability.

== All the Advanced Form Fields and Features You Need to Grow Your Business ==

Formidable goes far above and beyond with features like multi-page forms, save and continue, cascading form fields, powerful conditional logic. Then add partial submissions, invisible spam protection, front-end user post submission, calculated fields, user-tracking, quizzes, and so much more. Additionally, our Payment fields will help you create an order form, donation form, booking form, or other payment form.

We're on a mission to offer an all-in-one solution-focused WordPress form plugin. This way you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your form maker to do everything you want.

== Extend and Customize Your Forms - Developer's Dream Come True ==

Formidable is the WordPress form plugin of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies. It helps you build complex solutions and simple forms quickly to defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. That's why we made Formidable the most extendable WordPress form builder plugin on the market. We want to make it possible for anyone to defy gravity and build anything.

A Formidable View allows you to display form data anywhere, so you can quickly create data-driven web applications.

On top of that, our hooks and filters allow you to extend Formidable to meet your most advanced needs. We even include hundreds of code examples in our docs to give you the confidence to get started.

= Why isn't WordPress sending emails? =
When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

   1. Double check the email address in your Email action on the settings page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, notification emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different email address in your settings.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If these steps don't fix the problem and other WP emails are not going out, please reach out to your web host.
