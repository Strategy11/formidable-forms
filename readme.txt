Let's take a look at all the powerful form builder features that you get with Formidable Forms for making amazing contact forms, lead forms, subscription forms, request a quote forms, donation forms, payment order forms and more.

= Drag & Drop Contact Form Maker and Advanced Form Builder =

The Formidable Forms drag & drop form builder allows you to quickly create unlimited contact forms, surveys, quizzes, registration forms, and just about any other type of form that you want.

Our form builder plugin comes with all the powerful form fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

* Single line text (for names, phone numbers, addresses, and more)
* Email
* Website/URL
* Paragraph text
* Radio buttons
* Checkboxes
* Dropdown select boxes
* Number
* Phone number
* Hidden fields
* User ID
* HTML block

= Complete Entry Management for Contact Forms and Surveys =

Formidable Forms allows you to view all your contact form and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard.

Once a user submits a contact form, their response is automatically stored in your WordPress database. 

Formidable Forms is **100% GDPR-friendly**. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving contact form submissions entirely. Alternatively, you can add a GDPR checkbox field to your contact forms and payment forms to collect consent.

Need to import your contact form leads to another service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export contact form leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, and import anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited form email notifications and autoresponders triggered by contact form submissions. 

On top of that, you can easily customize the contact form success message the user sees after they submit the form, or redirect them to another page for your more advanced form needs.

= The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Form Styler =

With our built-in form styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your contact forms. With just a few clicks, your contact form, email form, and advanced forms can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, Formidable Forms applies a single styling template to all Formidable contact forms and advanced forms on your site. But if you want a custom form style for each individual contact form, sidebar form, and registration form, you can upgrade to Formidable Forms Pro.

= Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports = 

Aside from simple contact forms, Formidable Forms comes with a built-in survey feature, so you can quickly create powerful surveys and see beautiful reports.

The best part is that you can do this all within Formidable Forms without any third-party tools.

= Quickly Create Advanced Registration Forms for Any Use Case = 

Whether you need to create a youth sport team registration form, event registration form, or church retreat registration form, Formidable Forms has got you covered. Unlike other contact form plugins, Formidable Forms comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the most powerful registration forms.

Then, our marketing integrations and APIs can send the contact form and registration form data anywhere you want.

= Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments = 

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable Forms is more than just a contact form plugin. You can use Formidable Forms to create payment forms and accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create order forms and purchase forms with our drag & drop form builder. 

You can even use Formidable Forms to create WooCommerce forms with custom fields (more on that later).

= Grow Your Business with Marketing Integrations =

We know that marketing is the key to grow your business. That's why Formidable Forms allows you to connect contact forms, payment forms, and advanced forms with a marketing platform of your choice.

We integrate with popular email marketing services like:

* MailChimp
* AWeber
* Constant Contact
* GetResponse
* MailPoet
* Active Campaign
* Salesforce
* HubSpot

On top of these native integrations, we also integrate with Zapier, so you can quickly route your contact form data to over 1,000+ more services with just a few clicks.

= Create Data-Driven Web Applications with Formidable Views = 

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature that makes Formidable far more than just a form builder plugin. Views allow you to flexibly display any submitted form data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web applications like real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable Forms is not your average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

= Increase Your Sales with WooCommerce Product Forms = 

Formidable Forms is the only WordPress form builder plugin that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product forms, so you can increase your store sales.

You can use Formidable Forms to add a WooCommerce Product configurator with custom calculation fields, and automatically send the data to the WooCommerce cart with variable pricing options.

Need your customers to upload a file when they purchase a product? No problem. Simply drag & drop a file upload field into your WooCommerce form and you're done.

You can even show submitted form values in the WooCommerce purchase receipt emails as well as trigger SMS text messages or marketing integrations when an order is completed.

And of course, you can use Formidable Forms to add a simple contact form on your WooCommerce store.

= Build Powerful Quiz Forms & Calculators = 

Along with a contact form, you can also use the Formidable form builder plugin to create quiz forms and calculator forms.

Here are some example web calculators you can quickly add to your site:

* Advanced Mortgage Calculator
* Car Payment Calculator
* BMI Calculator
* User Age Calculator
* Online Quote Calculator
* Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey Calculator

... and our powerful form calculations allow you to build just about any other type of calculator form.

If that wasn't enough, you can also use our Formidable Form builder to create quizzes on your site and display results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Our goal is to go beyond simple contact forms and allow users to create form-based solutions without any code :)

= Create WordPress User Registration Forms, Profile Forms, and More = 

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need more advanced forms along with your contact form.

The Formidable Form builder plugin allows you to customize your WordPress user registration forms, so you can collect additional data when the user profile is created.

With our front-end form editing, you can also build custom profile forms and allow users to keep their profile updated, or even progressively add to the profile from a set of forms, from the first contact form to the last payment form.

Our front-end form editing feature is unique to us, and you will not find any other WordPress contact form plugin offering such a solution with the level of extendability that we do.

= Beautiful Graphs and Reports to Help You Analyze and Showcase Data = 

We believe that data alone does no good if you can't analyze it. That's why we make it easy for you to analyze your contact form, survey, quiz, calculator, and other form data with beautiful graphs and reports.

You can even showcase form data on the front-end of your website by embedding graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

= All the Advanced Form Fields and Features You Need to Grow Your Business =

Formidable Forms goes far above and beyond contact forms to offer all the advanced form fields and features you need to grow your business.

This includes things like multi-page forms, save and continue forms, cascading form fields, powerful conditional logic, partial form submissions, invisible spam protection, front-end user post submission, calculators, user-tracking, and so much more.

We're on a mission to offer an all-in-one solution-focused WordPress form plugin, so you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your contact form maker plugin to do everything you want.

= Extend and Customize Your Forms - Developer's Dream Come True =

Formidable Forms is the form plugin of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies because it helps them build complex form solutions and basic contact forms quickly and defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. We believe big projects don't always need big resources.

That's why we made Formidable Forms the most extendable WordPress form builder plugin on the market.

You can easily route your data from contact forms and advanced forms with our powerful API. Formidable Views allow you to display form data anywhere on the front-end, so you can quickly create data-driven web applications.

On top of that, our hooks and filters allow you to completely extend Formidable Forms to meet your needs. We even include hundreds of code examples in our docs to give you the confidence to get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get started with the best WordPress contact form plugin? =
The fastest way to build a contact form is to use the contact form template we built for you. After you activate Formidable Forms, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice. That's it!

Want to make a new contact form? Go to the Formidable -> Forms page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template on the form buider page and click "Load Template". Save your new contact form.

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page for the contact form. Click the "Formidable" button to open the form shortcode builder. Choose your contact form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the contact page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads.

= My contact forms are not sending emails. Why not? =
When you do not receive emails from your contact forms, try the following steps:

   1. Double check that your email address is present and correct in your Email form action on the form settings page of the form builder. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, form emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different email address in your contact form settings in the form builder.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If none of these steps fix the contact form email problem and no other WP emails are going out, please contact your web host.

= How do I edit the field names in the form maker? =
