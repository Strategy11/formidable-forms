Let's take a look at all the powerful features that you get with Formidable Forms.

= Drag & Drop Contact Form and Advanced Form Builder =

Formidable drag & drop form builder allows you to quickly create unlimited contact forms, surveys, quizzes, registration forms, and just about any other type of form that you want.

It comes with all the powerful form fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

* Single line text (for names, phone numbers, addresses, and more)
* Email
* Website/URL
* Paragraph text
* Radio buttons
* Checkboxes
* Dropdown select boxes
* Number
* Phone number
* Hidden fields
* User ID
* HTML block

With our built-in form styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your contact forms. With just a few clicks, your contact form and advanced forms can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, Formidable applies a single styling template to all contact form and advanced forms on your site. But if you want to have custom form style for each individual contact form and registration form, then you can upgrade to Formidable Forms Pro.

= Complete Entry Management for Contact Forms and Surveys =

Formidable Forms allows you to view all your contact form and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard.

Once a user submits your contact form, their response is automatically stored in your WordPress database. 

Formidable Forms is **100% GDPR-friendly**. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving form submissions entirely. Alternatively, you can add a GDPR checkbox field to your form to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to another service like MailChimp? No problem. **Export form leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, and import anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited form email notifications and autoresponders. 

On top of that, you can easily customize the contact form success message the user sees after they submit the form, or completely redirect them to another page for your more advanced form needs.

= Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports = 

Aside from simple contact forms, Formidable comes with a built-in survey feature, so you can quickly create powerful surveys and see beautiful reports.

The best part is that you can do this all within Formidable without using any third-party tool.

= Quickly Create Advanced Registration Forms for Any Use Case = 

Whether you need to create a youth sport team registration form, event registration form, or church retreat registration form, Formidable has got you covered.

Unlike other contact form plugins, Formidable comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the most powerful registration forms.

Then, you can use our marketing integrations and APIs to send this data anywhere you want.

= Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments = 

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable is more than just a contact form plugin. You can use Formidable to accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create order forms and purchase forms with our drag & drop interface. 

You can use Formidable to create WooCommerce forms (more on that later).

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature of this plugin. It allows you to flexibly display any submitted form data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web applications like real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable is not an average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

= Increase Your Sales with WooCommerce Product Forms = 

Formidable is the only WordPress form builder that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product forms, so you can increase your store sales.

Need your customers to upload a file when they purchase a product? No problem. Simply drag & drop a file upload field into your WooCommerce form and you're done.

You can even show submitted form values in the WooCommerce emails as well as trigger SMS text messages or marketing integrations when an order is completed.

And of course, you can also use Formidable to add a simple contact form on your WooCommerce store.

= Build Powerful Quizzes & Calculators = 

Along with a contact form, you can also use Formidable form builder to create quizzes and calculator forms.

Here are some example web calculators that you can quickly add to your site:

* Advanced Mortgage Calculator

... and our powerful calculation fields allow you to build just about any other type of calculator. 

If that wasn't enough, you can also use Formidable Form builder to create quizzes on your site and display results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Our goal is go beyond simple contact forms and allow users to create form-based solutions without any code :)

= Create WordPress User Registration Forms, Profile Forms, and More = 

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need more advanced forms along with your contact form.

Formidable Form builder allows you to customize your WordPress user registration forms, so you can collect additional data when the user profile is being created.

Our front-end form editing feature is unique to us, and you will not find any other WordPress contact form plugin offering such solution with the level of extendability that we do.

= Beautiful Graphs and Reports to Help You Analyze and Showcase Data = 

We believe that data by itself does no good if you can't analyze it. That's why we make it easy for you to analyze your contact form, survey, quiz, and other form data with beautiful graphs and reports.

You can even showcase the form data on the front-end of your website by embedding the graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

We're on a mission to offer an all-in-one solution focused WordPress form plugin, so you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your contact form plugin to do everything that you want.

= Extend and Customize Your Forms - Developer's Dream Come True = 

Formidable is the form plugin of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies because it helps them build complex form solutions quickly.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. We believe big projects don't always need big resources.

That's why we made Formidable the most extendable WordPress form builder plugin in the market.

You can easily route your form data with our powerful API. Formidable Views allow you to display your form data anywhere on the front-end, so you can quickly create data-driven web applications.

The fastest way to build a contact form is to use the contact form template we built for you. After you activate Formidable Forms, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice. That's it!

Want to make a new contact form? Go to the Formidable -> Forms page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template and click "Load Template". Now Save your contact form.

Next, go to edit the page where you would like to publish your contact form. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode builder. Choose your contact form and insert it into your WordPress page. Save your page, and you're done.

Get more detail on <a href="https://formidableforms.com/wordpress-contact-form-template-to-unique/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">using the contact form template</a> in our blog.

= My contact forms are not sending emails. Why not? =

Try the following steps:

   1. Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in your Email form action on the form "Settings" page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...). If these emails don't work on your site, form emails will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box
   4. Try a different email address in your contact form settings.
   5. Install Postman SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If none of these steps fix the problem with your form emails, and other site emails are not going out, please contact your web host. You can also <a href="https://formidableforms.com/wordpress-not-sending-emails-smtp/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">read more about WordPress emails not sending</a> in our blog.

= How do I edit the field names in my forms? =

The field and form names and descriptions are all changed with in-place edit. Just click on the text you would like to change, and it will turn into a text field.
