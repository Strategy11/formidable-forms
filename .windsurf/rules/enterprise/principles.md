# General Principles

Baseline rules that apply across the Formidable Forms plugin ecosystem.

## Writing Style for Generated Text

Applies to all generated text: PR titles, PR body, commit messages, comments, and etc.

- **No em dashes** (`—` or `–`): use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence
- **No semicolons** (`;`): split into separate sentences instead
- **Full GitHub URL** for issue references (e.g., `https://github.com/Strategy11/formidable-pro/issues/3030`), never shorthand `#number` (PRs may target a different repo than the issue)
- **No hard-wrapping** in PR body text: let GitHub handle line wrapping. The 72-char wrap rule applies only to **commit message bodies**
