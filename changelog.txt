== Changelog ==
= 6.27 =
* New: Displaying payments is now handled by this plugin, instead of falling back to Stripe, Authorize.Net, and PayPal. In cases where these add-ons were active, the payments table should now appear more modern.
* New: A new coupons tab is available on the payments page.
* New: Required updates to support a new View-Specific CSS setting in the Visual Views add-on.
* New: The submit button will now be enabled when a Square postal code is successfully completed. This fixes issues where the submit button would never get enabled when a Square card field was auto-filled.
* New: Many references to old font icons have been removed, removing about 10KB of data from admin CSS.
* New: Several styles have been optimized in the generated formidableforms.css file when Pro is not active, helping to reduce file size by removing references to features that only exist in Pro.

* Fix: The style-specific custom CSS setting would incorrectly get output in the formidableforms.css file as CSS variable data.

* Fix: Add-on category counts were not always correct.
* Breaking: Many modern PHP functions are now being used including str_contains, str_starts_with, str_ends_with, array_key_last, and array_key_first. If you are using both a WordPress version older than 5.9, and a PHP version lower than 8.0, this will introduce fatal errors. Note that the minimum required WordPress version is already set to 6.3.
* Breaking: The deprecated functions FrmFieldCaptcha::captcha_size, FrmFormsHelper::should_use_pro_for_ajax_submit, FrmFormsController::add_form_style_tab_options, and FrmFieldType::get_select_atributes have been removed.

* An unused FrmTransLiteSubscriptionsController::list_subscriptions_shortcode function and its related view file have been deprecated.

= 6.26.1 =
* New: The cached data for license checks is now set to autoload to help reduce calls to the database, and an option check for a request lock has been moved so it only happens when the option data has expired. These changes should help with performance.
* New: SVG icon updates have been made to avoid use of the deprecated xlink:href attribute.
* Fix: Field step settings were changed to only accept numbers in last release, causing issues with "any" as a value.

* Fix: Square would throw a styling error when using a style with comma separated font family options. To prevent this error, the first font is used only.
* Fix: The mobile responsiveness of email styles has been improved.

* **Pro Forms Features:**
* Views can now be filtered by fields in the repeating sections.
* Added [parent_id] shortcode for use in views. This shortcode will only have a value when the displaying entries in repeating sections.
* Allow views to be created using the repeated entries. Since each repeating row is an entry in a hidden form, we can allow views to be created using those repeating rows for more flexibility.
* Added order parameter to frm-entry-links
* Allow options in a post status field to come from the form builder. The options should have separate values and the saved values can include 'publish', 'draft', 'private', 'scheduled'.
* Remove the option to lock field and form keys. This is more of a hassle than a feature.
* Allow the entry key to be used with the frm-field-value shortcode instead of forcing the entry

* Fix: When forms were submitted without ajax, the redirect wasn't working consistently.
* Fix: The shortcodes weren't processing in the message shown after an entry is updated. 
* Fix: When we prevented the PayPal action from triggering on import, we stopped all actions. This is now fixed so an action can be set (in the code) to be triggered on import. Posts will now be created on import again.
* Fix: The dynamic list field was showing the entry ID in the entries tab instead of the value.
* Fix: The Add row button wasn't showing in a repeating section when returning to edit an entry if there were more than two rows in the section.
* Fix: Improve dropping a field between two sections.
* Fix: Remove nonce check for frm-entry-update-field shortode. Page caching gives front-end nonce checks issues.
* Fix: We changed the parameters sent to the frm_after_update_field hook without realizing it. The 'field_id' attribute was sometimes an object, but was previously always an integer. This has been updated for reverse compatibility, and 'field' has been added with the full field object.
* Fix: If you put -100 for the start date in a date field, -100 would show in the date field instead of 1915. This is now working correctly for dynamic values like this with three digits.
* Fix: When filtering a view with a Dynamic field, NOT EQUAL TO will work correctly.
* Fix: Double quotes were causing trouble when included inside an error message returned by the frm_validate_field_entry hook
* Fix: Graphs using x_axis and start_date were having trouble
* Fix: The js error after selecting an option in autocomplete field is fixed when there are calculations in the form.
